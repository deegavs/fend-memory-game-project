## Descriptions

This Game is a Memory Game to practice or find out how good your memory is. It is an online Game built with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

## Instructions

Player is required to match cards. Click on cards within the grid to make a match. There are different icons with a match. When a match is made the cards stay flipped. You win the Game by matching all the cards. Your time and moves will count as you play. You'll be rated with stars. Match cards in less time and less moves to get more or full 3 stars. You can play against yourself to beat your previous score.   

## Issues

The reset function of the game has bug. When clicking a card and hitting reset and clicking on a card triggers a match. This issue has been solved within the `startGame function`.
