## Descriptions

This is a Memory Game Project for students in the Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree program. The Game is basically to practice or find out how good your memory is. It is an online Game built with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Game Instructions

The Player is required to match cards. Click on cards within the grid to make a match. There are different icons with a match. When a match is made the cards stay flipped. You win the Game by matching all the cards. Your time and moves will count as you play. You'll be rated with stars. Match cards in less time and less moves to get more or full 3 stars. You can play against yourself to beat your previous score.   

## Issues

The reset function of the game has bug. When clicking a card and hitting reset and clicking on a card triggers a match. This issue has been solved within the `startGame function`.

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

For details, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Project Dependencies

The Project is built on Udacity's static `starter code`.

The `starter code` markup and styles has to be modified to alter the styles efficiently develop the interactivity and the logic of the game.
1. **Design**
- Fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
- Icons from [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
- Background image from [subtlepatterns.com](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/page/9/).

2. **Functionality**
- The interactivity and logic of the game is developed by manipulating the DOM with [Vanilla JS](https://www.sitepoint.com/dom-manipulation-vanilla-javascript-no-jquery/).
- Create a popup window with [modal box](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp).
